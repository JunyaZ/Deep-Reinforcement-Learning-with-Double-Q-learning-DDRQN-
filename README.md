# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-with-Double-Q-learning-DDRQN-
###### we applied reinforcement learning on first person shooter (FPS) games.
###### We trained a agent in platform ViZDoom to play the game Doom. A technique called Double Q-Learning was shown to remedy the problem by using two Q-functions and decoupling the selection and evaluation of the action. 
###### Our proposed model synthesizes a Double Q-Network and a Deep Recurrent Q-Network, to implement a Double Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DDRQN). We compare our model to a single Deep Recurrent Q-Network where the agent is required to defend the center of the environment until either the agentâ€™s health is exhausted, or time runs out.
